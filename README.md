ðŸ”¹ How It Works
User Registration

A user registers using an email, username, and password.

The password is securely hashed before storing it in MySQL.

User Login

The user logs in using email and password.

If correct, a JWT token is issued, which is required for further API access.

Notes Management

Only authenticated users can create, update, delete, and retrieve their notes.

Each note is linked to a specific user, ensuring data privacy.
